2a) The height of the tree is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path from a leaf to the root. Greene to Weaver is the longest path and is made up of 4 notes. Hence, 
the height of the tree is 4. The following nodes have no children and are leaves: Benton, Hathaway, Weaver. Morganstern has 1 node on its level in the tree: Carter. Therefore,
Carter is its only sibling. 

2b)
    Preorder: Greene, Carter, Benton, Morganstern, Hathaway, Ross, Weaver
    Inorder: Benton, Carter, Greene, Hathaway, Morganstern, Ross, Weaver 
    Postorder: Benton, Carter, Hathaway, Weaver, Ross, Morganstern, Greene

2c) Del Amico would end up as Carter's right child. 

2d) Greene was the 1st node entered into the tree. 

2e) This algorithm is the level order traversal algortihm. That is, the algorithm visits the nodes level by level starting from the root's level. For this tree, the order would
be: Greene, Carter, Morganstern, Benton, Hathaway, Ross, Weaver. This algorithm is also known as Breadth First Search because it first visits the root, then nodes that are 1
level away, then 2 levels, and so on.
